# Abstract
In order to develop an application for smart homes, the related bibliography was studied from which it became clear that researchers were very interested in intelligent applications, which aim to cover the needs of the elderly/patients at home. Focusing more on studying such works and applications, it was decided that a system should be developed that would fulfill some scenarios that could be used by these individuals. Then, a detailed analysis of requirements was made and the roles of the individual applications of a distributed system were defined, which should be developed. At the same time, a search was conducted so as to find the most appropriate technologies, programming languages and programming tools to create the system. Subsequently, the technical details were designed, and the pilot implementation of the system followed. Finally, a check was made to show that the system performs all initial use case scenarios, some future system extensions were recorded, and some conclusions were drawn from the overall project.

### Abstract
Today, there is a growing interest for a combination of intelligent applications and assistive mechanisms, which aims to cover the needs of the elderly persons/patients living alone. We focus on the design and implementation of a distributed Information System used to support the elderly persons/patients at home. First, user requirements are captured, then the architecture of a distributed Information System (IS) is given, and eventually functions of the IS and the role of people involved into the system are discussed. We use new technologies and tools to implement a prototype of a low cost “smart” home, and eventually some conclusions are given.
